I graduated in Computer Science for Games at Brighton University and have been coding since I was 13 with Java, JS, Pyton, C#, C++, Rust and more.\
I couldn't think of anything else to write so here is some extra text to make this section look way longer than it actually is and so it doesn't look strange to have a fancy colored title and then like one line under it. Hope you enjoyed this extra text!
